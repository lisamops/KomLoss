abstract = {To be successful takes creativity, flexibility, self-control, and discipline. Central to all those are executive functions, including mentally playing with ideas, giving a considered rather than an impulsive response, and staying focused. Diverse activities have been shown to improve children's executive functions: computerized training, noncomputerized games, aerobics, martial arts, yoga, mindfulness, and school curricula. All successful programs involve repeated practice and progressively increase the challenge to executive functions. Children with worse executive functions benefit most from these activities; thus, early executive-function training may avert widening achievement gaps later. To improve executive functions, focusing narrowly on them may not be as effective as also addressing emotional and social development (as do curricula that improve executive functions) and physical development (shown by positive effects of aerobics, martial arts, and yoga).},

abstract = {Group-matching designs are commonly used to identify the diagnosis-specific characteristics of children with developmental disabilities. In this paper, we address three issues central to the use of this design. The first concerns the $\alpha$ level to be used for considering groups to be matched on the control variable(s). The second involves the measurement characteristics of the control and target variables. We discuss the properties of standard scores, raw scores, and age equivalents and argue against the use of age equivalents. In addition, we consider the appropriateness of the commonly made prediction that groups that are matched for a control variable such as language ability or nonverbal reasoning ability but are not matched for chronological age should perform at equivalent levels on the target variable. Finally, we discuss issues related to the interpretation of significant between-group differences on the target variable, assuming groups are well-matched on the control variables, and describe the benefits of a method that focuses on characterizing a disorder on a case-by-case basis and then aggregating the cases, using the measures of sensitivity and specificity from signal detection theory.},

abstract = {This article considers the scientific process whereby new and better clinical tests of executive function might be developed, and what form they might take. We argue that many of the traditional tests of executive function most commonly in use (e.g., the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; Stroop) are adaptations of procedures that emerged almost coincidentally from conceptual and experimental frameworks far removed from those currently in favour, and that the prolongation of their use has been encouraged by a sustained period of concentration on "construct-driven" experimentation in neuropsychology. This resulted from the special theoretical demands made by the field of executive function, but was not a necessary consequence, and may not even have been a useful one. Whilst useful, these tests may not therefore be optimal for their purpose. We consider as an alternative approach a function-led development programme which in principle could yield tasks better suited to the concerns of the clinician because of the transparency afforded by increased "representativeness" and "generalisability." We further argue that the requirement of such a programme to represent the interaction between the individual and situational context might also provide useful constraints for purely experimental investigations. We provide an example of such a programme with reference to the Multiple Errands and Six Element tests.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
There is a long-held view that verbal short-term memory problems of individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) might be due to a deficit in verbal rehearsal. However, the evidence is inconclusive and word length effects as indicator of rehearsal have been criticised. 

AIM {\&} METHOD
The aim of this multi-site European study was to investigate verbal rehearsal in adolescents with mild ID (n=90) and a comparison group of typically developing children matched individually for mental age (MA, n=90). The investigation involved: (1) a word length experiment with non-verbal recall using pointing and (2) ‘self-paced' inspection times to infer whether verbal strategies were utilised when memorising a set of pictorial items. 

RESULTS
The word length effect on recall did not interact with group, suggesting that adolescents with ID and MA comparisons used similar verbal strategies, possibly phonological recoding of picture names. The inspection time data suggested that high span individuals in both groups used verbal labelling or single item rehearsal on more demanding lists, as long named items had longer inspection times. 

CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that verbal strategy use is not specifically impaired in adolescents with mild ID and is mental age appropriate, supporting a developmental perspective.},

Difference theorists contend that all mental retardation stems from underlying organic dysfunctions that result in specific deficits in cognitive functioning and atypical cognitive development. Developmental theorists believe that this description applies only to individuals whose retardation is caused by organic impairments. They view individuals with cultural-familial retardation as representing the lower portion of the normal distribution of intelligence. As such, they should follow the same overall pattern of development as nonimpaired individuals but will progress at a slower rate and ultimately attain a lower asymptote of cognitive functioning. Thus, the debate represents basic theoretical conflicts over the etiology of the dysfunction, the relationship of the impairment to cognitive functioning, and the developmental consequences for individuals with mental retardation. These issues have important implications in identifying, educating, and integrating individuals with mental retardation into society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2000 APA, all rights reserved)},

We argue that which components are required and which developmental changes are triggered or revealed depend on the planning task. We present analyses of three tasks typically used to study planning: the Tower of Hanoi; errand scheduling; and story comprehension. We argue that the performance on the Tower of Hanoi task reflects representational and monitoring demands, and that story comprehension depends strongly on social comprehension and monitoring. Because many everyday plans like running errands have prepackaged components and take place in a less controllable environment, affective and attributional components affect most strongly the choice of goals, decision to plan, and strategy choice. We then speculate on the course of development of each processing component and the complex interplay of cognition, beliefs, attitudes, and motivation in assembling and implementing plans to handle different tasks. Finally, we consider changes across the life span in the kinds of plans that are generated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present work is aimed at analysing executive function (EF) in adolescents with Down Syndrome (DS). So far, EF has been analysed mainly in adults with DS, showing a pattern of impairment. However, less is known about children and adolescents with this syndrome. Studying adolescents with DS might help us better understand whether performances on EF tasks of individuals with DS are determined by age or by Alzheimer disease, as some studies suggest, or whether their performances are directly related to DS cognitive profile. METHOD: A battery of EF tasks assessing set shifting, planning/problem-solving, working memory, inhibition/perseveration and fluency, as well as a tasks assessing sustained attention has been administered to a group of 15 adolescents with DS and 15 typically developing children matched for mental age. All EF tasks were selected from previous studies with individuals with intellectual disabilities or from developmental literature and are thought to be useful for the samples considered. RESULTS: The present results revealed that the group of individuals with DS performed at a significantly lower level on tasks assessing set shifting, planning/problem-solving, working memory and inhibition/perseveration, but not on the tasks assessing fluency. In addition, individuals with DS demonstrated a greater number of errors and less strategy use for the sustained attention task. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a broad impairment in EF in adolescents with DS, and are consistent with several similar studies conducted with adults with DS. We assume that EF deficit is a characteristic of DS.},

A 5-factor model included discourse, EFs (e.g., problem solving, planning), processing speed (e.g., coding), declarative memory, and motor speed. Confirmatory factor analysis based on data obtained from 265 pediatric TBI patients at 3 months postinjury disclosed that the 5-factor model provided a good fit to the data. A second exploratory analysis of the 3-month postinjury data disclosed a 4-factor model in which processing speed and motor speed measures loaded on a common factor. Severity of TBI and age at test had significant effects on all factors in both the 5- and 4-factor models. Adaptive functioning, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale-Revised, was moderately related to factor scores at 3 years or longer postinjury, but weakly related to factor scores obtained at 3 months postinjury. The factor scores could be used in clinical trials to facilitate data reduction and appear to have validity as indicators of TBI outcome.},

Participants in four age groups (7-, 11-, 15-, and 21-year olds) carried out nine basic experimental tasks (three tasks for each EF), the WCST, and the ToL. Analyses were done in two steps: (1) analyses of (co)variance to examine developmental trends in individual EF tasks while correcting for basic processing speed, (2) confirmatory factor analysis to extract latent variables from the nine basic EF tasks, and to explain variance in the performance on WCST and ToL, using these latent variables. Analyses of (co)variance revealed a continuation of EF development into adolescence. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded two common factors: Working Memory and Shifting. However, the variables assumed to tap Inhibition proved unrelated. At a latent level, again correcting for basic processing speed, the development of Shifting was seen to continue into adolescence, while Working Memory continued to develop into young-adulthood. Regression analyses revealed that Working Memory contributed most strongly to WCST performance in all age groups. These results suggest that EF component processes develop at different rates, and that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of EF component processes in studying the development of EF.},

Digit span backwards (DSB), response inhibition, and IQ were correlated with TOL performance. DSB contributed to TOL accuracy above and beyond age and IQ. Inhibitory control and DSB both contributed to the modulation of planning times across problems. Self-reported inattention and hyperactivity were associated with low performance.

abstract = {Research on the development of planning is reviewed in the context of a framework that considers the role of three types of cognitive flexibility in planning development: event-independent temporal representation, executive function, and self-projection. It is argued that the emergence of planning abilities in the preschool period is dependent upon the development of event-independent temporal representation. Research on the development of executive function suggests that its sub-components, in particular inhibitory control, may be linked to developmental improvements on planning tasks. Recently, new paradigms have established that self-projection to the future appears to develop over the preschool period. We consider how these different forms of cognitive flexibility may themselves be related in development. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The primary focus of this study was to asses the relationship among different measures on the ToL. A secondary purpose was to examine the putative relationship between intelligence and working memory with that of ToL performance. Analyses of the interrelation of several ToL parameters indicated that better ToL performance was associated with longer preplanning time and shorter movement execution time. Good performers showed a stronger increase in preplanning duration with task difficulty then intermediate or poor planners. Stepwise multiple regression analysis yield fluid intelligence as the only significant predictor of ToL performance.

@article{Arain2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2004, a review of pilot studies published in seven major medical journals during 2000-01 recommended that the statistical analysis of such studies should be either mainly descriptive or focus on sample size estimation, while results from hypothesis testing must be interpreted with caution. We revisited these journals to see whether the subsequent recommendations have changed the practice of reporting pilot studies. We also conducted a survey to identify the methodological components in registered research studies which are described as 'pilot' or 'feasibility' studies. We extended this survey to grant-awarding bodies and editors of medical journals to discover their policies regarding the function and reporting of pilot studies. METHODS: Papers from 2007-08 in seven medical journals were screened to retrieve published pilot studies. Reports of registered and completed studies on the UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN) Portfolio database were retrieved and scrutinized. Guidance on the conduct and reporting of pilot studies was retrieved from the websites of three grant giving bodies and seven journal editors were canvassed. RESULTS: 54 pilot or feasibility studies published in 2007-8 were found, of which 26 (48{\%}) were pilot studies of interventions and the remainder feasibility studies. The majority incorporated hypothesis-testing (81{\%}), a control arm (69{\%}) and a randomization procedure (62{\%}). Most (81{\%}) pointed towards the need for further research. Only 8 out of 90 pilot studies identified by the earlier review led to subsequent main studies. Twelve studies which were interventional pilot/feasibility studies and which included testing of some component of the research process were identified through the UKCRN Portfolio database. There was no clear distinction in use of the terms 'pilot' and 'feasibility'. Five journal editors replied to our entreaty. In general they were loathe to publish studies described as 'pilot'. CONCLUSION: Pilot studies are still poorly reported, with inappropriate emphasis on hypothesis-testing. Authors should be aware of the different requirements of pilot studies, feasibility studies and main studies and report them appropriately. Authors should be explicit as to the purpose of a pilot study. The definitions of feasibility and pilot studies vary and we make proposals here to clarify terminology.},

abstract = {Children with intellectual disabilities show deficits in both reasoning ability and working memory (WM) that impact everyday functioning and academic achievement. In this study we investigated the feasibility of cognitive training for improving WM and non-verbal reasoning (NVR) ability in children with intellectual disability. Participants were randomized to a 5-week adaptive training program (intervention group) or non-adaptive version of the program (active control group). Cognitive assessments were conducted prior to and directly after training and 1 year later to examine effects of the training. Improvements during training varied largely and amount of progress during training predicted transfer to WM and comprehension of instructions, with higher training progress being associated with greater transfer improvements. The strongest predictors for training progress were found to be gender, co-morbidity, and baseline capacity on verbal WM. In particular, females without an additional diagnosis and with higher baseline performance showed greater progress. No significant effects of training were observed at the 1-year follow-up, suggesting that training should be more intense or repeated in order for effects to persist in children with intellectual disabilities. A major finding of this study is that cognitive training is feasible in this clinical sample and can help improve their cognitive performance. However, a minimum cognitive capacity or training ability seems necessary for the training to be beneficial, with some individuals showing little improvement in performance. Future studies of cognitive training should take into consideration how inter-individual differences in training progress influence transfer effects and further investigate how baseline capacities predict training outcome.},

Results showed that all groups used ATC, most in the Habilitation group and least in the TD group.

abstract = {BackgroundThe World Health Organisation has launched a programme to promote Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology. Its aim is to increase access to high-quality affordable assistive products (AP) for everybody in need. People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are a specific group that could benefit from AP, but use less AP compared to their non-intellectual disabled peers. MethodA systematic literature search was carried out to identify barriers and potential facilitators for access to AP for people with ID globally. The search strategy terms were Intellectual Disability' and Assistive Technology' with the following electronic literature databases PubMed, Embase, ASSIA, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL complete, PsycInfo, Scopus and ERIC. The quality and relevance of the studies were assessed. Factors associated with access were identified thematically, categorised into barriers and facilitators and mapped into themes. ResultsIn all, 22 key studies were retrieved, describing 77 barriers and 56 facilitators. The most frequently reported barriers were related to lack of funding and cost of AP, lack of awareness about AP and inadequate assessment. An increase of knowledge and awareness about AP and the need of AP for people with ID were most often extracted as factors that could potentially facilitate access. ConclusionsThis review proposes actions linked to the barriers and facilitators that have a particular importance for people with ID to access AP. Yet, only limited research is available describing factors that influence access to AP for people with ID in low and middle income countries and rural areas.},

We compared performance of patients with schizophrenia; Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, which are disorders associated with some impairment of executive function. Findings indicated that all three measures successfully discriminated between patient groups and controls. Correlational analysis suggested a strong association between test scores on these measures, which were only moderately related to performance on nonexecutive function measures. It is concluded that the three tasks are sensitive and relatively homogeneous in their recruitment of executive functions.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that executive functions (EFs) are related to intelligence, despite neuro- psychological results initially considered evidence of no such relation. However, findings that EFs are not unitary raise the issue of how intelligence relates to different EFs. This study examined the relations of fluid and crystallized intelligence and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IQ to three separable EFs--inhibiting prepotent responses (inhibiting), shifting mental sets (shifting), and updating working memory (updating)--in young adults. Updating was highly correlated with the intelligence measures, but inhibiting and shifting were not. Furthermore, in structural equation models controlling for the inter-EF correlations, updating remained strongly related to intelligence, but the relations of inhibiting and shifting to intelligence were small and not significant. The results indicate that intelligence measures differentially relate to these three EFs, suggesting that current intelligence measures do not equally assess a wide range of executive control abilities likely required for many "intelligent" behaviors.},

This article aims at reviewing some of the current knowledge surrounding executive functioning and presenting the contrasting views regarding this concept. The neural substrates of the executive system are examined as well as the evolution of executive functioning, from development to decline. There is clear evidence of the vulnerability of executive functions to the effects of age over lifespan. The first executive function to emerge in children is the ability to inhibit overlearned behavior and the last to appear is verbal fluency. Inhibition of irrelevant information seems to decline earlier than set shifting and verbal fluency during senescence. The sequential progression and decline of these functions has been paralleled with the anatomical changes of the frontal lobe and its connections with other brain areas. Generalization of the results presented here are limited due to methodological differences across studies. Analysis of these differences is presented and suggestions for future research are offered.},

@article{Ardila2008,
abstract = {In this paper it is proposed that the prefrontal lobe participates in two closely related but different executive function abilities: (1) "metacognitive executive functions": problem solving, planning, concept formation, strategy development and implementation, controlling attention, working memory, and the like; that is, executive functions as they are usually understood in contemporary neuroscience; and (2) "emotional/motivational executive functions": coordinating cognition and emotion/motivation (that is, fulfilling biological needs according to some existing conditions). The first one depends on the dorsolateral prefrontal areas, whereas the second one is associated with orbitofrontal and medial frontal areas. Current tests of executive functions basically tap the first ability (metacognitive). Solving everyday problems (functional application of executive functions), however, mostly requires the second ability (emotional/motivational); therefore, these tests have limited ecological validity. Contrary to the traditional points of view, recent evidence suggests that the human prefrontal lobe is similar to other primates and hominids. Other primates and hominids may possess the second (emotional executive functions) prefrontal ability, -but not the first (metacognitive executive functions) one. It is argued that metacognitive executive functions are significantly dependent on culture and cultural instruments. They probably are the result of the development and evolution of some "conceptualization instruments"; language (and written language as an extension of oral language) may represent the most important one. The second executive function ability (emotional/motivational) probably is the result of a biological evolution shared by other primates. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Method Correlations were examined between IQ and (i) self-rated (n = 72) ability, participation as performance (how often an activity is performed), important participation restriction (not/seldom performing an activity perceived as important) and general well-being and (ii) proxy-rated (n = 41) ability and participation as performance. Results No significant correlations between IQ and any of the explored measures were found. However, the effect sizes of the correlations between IQ and ability were considered as small but not negligible. Conclusions The results support the notion that IQ is a poor predictor of general aspects of everyday functioning in persons with mild/borderline intellectual disability. The result indicates that self-ratings partly generate other information than proxy ratings which may be important for assessments of supportive requirements and diagnosis.},

abstract = {A major debate in the mental-rotation literature concerns the question of whether objects are represented holistically during rotation. Effects of object complexity on rotational speed are considered strong evidence against such holistic representations. In Experiment 1, such an effect of object complexity was markedly present. A closer look on individual performance patterns, however, revealed that only some participants showed this effect. For others, rotational speed was independent of object complexity. The assumption that these fast-rotating participants use a holistic representation that equally well holds simple and complex objects would explain these results. Taking error rates into account disproved this explanation: Fast participants simply committed more errors in those conditions for which careful participants invested more rotation time. Whether this speed-accuracy trade-off is a stable personality trait or a somewhat flexible strategic choice was examined in Experiments 2 and 3. In Experiment 2, participants received monetary incentives that encouraged them to minimize errors. In line with a certain degree of flexible strategic control over speed-accuracy trade-offs, a large majority of participants showed effects of object complexity on rotational speed. When, in contrast, time pressure was induced in Experiment 3, error rates increased considerably and most participants' rotational speed became independent of object complexity. Our results indicate that all our participants performed mental rotation on a nonholistic representation and that apparent holistic processing strategies in mental rotation (and potentially also in other spatial tasks) might actually be speed-accuracy trade-offs in disguise.

@article{Liesefeld2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Psychonomic Society, Inc. In psychological experiments, participants are typically instructed to respond as fast as possible without sacrificing accuracy. How they interpret this instruction and, consequently, which speed–accuracy trade-off they choose might vary between experiments, between participants, and between conditions. Consequently, experimental effects can appear unpredictably in either RTs or error rates (i.e., accuracy). Even more problematic, spurious effects might emerge that are actually due only to differential speed–accuracy trade-offs. An often-suggested solution is the inverse efficiency score (IES; Townsend {\&} Ashby, 1983), which combines speed and accuracy into a single score. Alternatives are the rate-correct score (RCS; Woltz {\&} Was, 2006) and the linear-integrated speed–accuracy score (LISAS; Vandierendonck, 2017, 2018). We report analyses on simulated data generated with the standard diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) showing that IES, RCS, and LISAS put unequal weights on speed and accuracy, depending on the accuracy level, and that these measures are actually very sensitive to speed–accuracy trade-offs. These findings stand in contrast to a fourth alternative, the balanced integration score (BIS; Liesefeld, Fu, {\&} Zimmer, 2015), which was devised to integrate speed and accuracy with equal weights. Although all of the measures maintain “real” effects, only BIS is relatively insensitive to speed–accuracy trade-offs.},

All 3 had severe difficulties in 2 tests which required them to carry out a number of fairly simple but open-ended tasks over a 15 — 30 min period. They typically spent too long on individual tasks. All patients scored well on tests of perception, language and intelligence and 2 performed well on a variety of other tests of frontal lobe function. Explanations for their difficulty on the multiple subgoal tasks in terms of memory or motivational problems could be excluded. It is argued that the problem arose from an inability to reactivate after a delay previously-generated intentions when they are not directly signalled by the stimulus situation.},

In particular, the Multiple Errands Test is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = 10), and healthy older participants (n = 10). The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups. These results suggest a possible future application of such an ecological approach for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of stroke patients and elderly population with age-related cognitive decline. {\textcopyright} 2012 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

Extended to ADHD, the model predicts that ADHD should be associated with secondary impairments in these 4 executive abilities and the motor control they afford. The author reviews evidence for each of these domains of functioning and finds it to be strongest for deficits in behavioral inhibition, working memory, regulation of motivation, and motor control in those with ADHD. Although the model is promising as a potential theory of self-control and ADHD, far more research is required to evaluate its merits and the many predictions it makes about ADHD.},

In the Betula database, a group of adults with intellectual disability (ID, n=46) was defined from measures of verbal and non-verbal IQ. A control group, with two people for every person with intellectual disability (n=92), was chosen by matching on the following criterion in order of priority: IQ higher than 85, age, sex, sample, level of education, and years of education. Three types of tasks of executive functions were included on two occasions, with 5 years between testing sessions: The Tower of Hanoi, executively loaded dual task versions of word recall, and verbal fluency. Adults with ID showed significant impairments on verbal fluency and on the executively loaded dual task word recall task (at encoding but not at recall). There were no group differences on the Tower of Hanoi. No significant differences between the two test occasions were found. The results are interpreted in terms of individuals with ID having problems with speed of accessing lexical items and difficulties with working memory-related executive control at encoding, which includes shifting between tasks. There are, however, not necessarily problems with inhibition. The dual task results additionally imply that the adults with intellectual disability were more sensitive to strategy interruptions at encoding, but that dividing attention at recall did not have such detrimental effects.},

abstract = {The matching of groups is a traditional way to control for confounding variables in developmental disabilities research. The equivalency of means across groups is routinely checked for these variables, but not the homogeneity of their variances or the shapes of their distributions. In the present paper, it is argued that group matching can go seriously wrong unless it directly confronts the distributional concerns by the use of well-known statistical indices and very simple graphical displays of the distributions. The question of the equivalency of item response profiles is also addressed since two participants or two groups of participants can obtain the same overall score on the matching variable by passing different items. In this case, the matching cannot be considered satisfactory because of poor concordance between the molar (overall score) and molecular (item scores) levels of matching. Angoff's Delta plot method, a statistical approach for detecting differential item functioning across small groups is described. It is promising as a simple way to prove whole test/individual item correspondence and, in addition, a useful tool for making post hoc statistical analyses at the item level on the dependent variables. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: We briefly describe the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL), an open source software system for designing and running psychological experiments. New method: We describe the PEBL Test Battery, a set of approximately 70 behavioral tests which can be freely used, shared, and modified. Included is a comprehensive set of past research upon which tests in the battery are based. Results: We report the results of benchmark tests that establish the timing precision of PEBL. Comparison with existing method: We consider alternatives to the PEBL system and battery tests. Conclusions: We conclude with a discussion of the ethical factors involved in the open source testing movement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The relationship between assistive technology for cognition (ATC) and cognitive function was examined using a systematic review. A literature search identified 89 publications reporting 91 studies of an ATC intervention in a clinical population. The WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) was used to categorize the cognitive domains being assisted and the tasks being performed. Results show that ATC have been used to effectively support cognitive functions relating to attention, calculation, emotion, experience of self, higher level cognitive functions (planning and time management) and memory. The review makes three contributions: (1) It reviews existing ATC in terms of cognitive function, thus providing a framework for ATC prescription on the basis of a profile of cognitive deficits, (2) it introduces a new classification of ATC based on cognitive function, and (3) it identifies areas for future ATC research and development.

Some people with intellectual disabilities have difficulties with self-reporting due to problems of understanding and communication. However, there are serious doubts about the validity of proxy data for subjective issues. One important challenge with secondary analysis of population-based data sets is the difficulty of accurately identifying survey participants with intellectual disabilities. In both areas examined, it is important to recognize these constraints when interpreting research based on such data.},

abstract = {Children with ADHD are characterized frequently as possessing underdeveloped executive functions and sustained attentional abilities, and recent commercial claims suggest that computer-based cognitive training can remediate these impairments and provide significant and lasting improvement in their attention, impulse control, social functioning, academic performance, and complex reasoning skills. The present review critically evaluates these claims through meta-analysis of 25 studies of facilitative intervention training (i.e., cognitive training) for children with ADHD. Random effects models corrected for publication bias and sampling error revealed that studies training short-term memory alone resulted in moderate magnitude improvements in short-term memory (d= 0.63), whereas training attention did not significantly improve attention and training mixed executive functions did not significantly improve the targeted executive functions (both nonsignificant: 95{\%} confidence intervals include 0.0). Far transfer effects of cognitive training on academic functioning, blinded ratings of behavior (both nonsignificant), and cognitive tests (d= 0.14) were nonsignificant or negligible. Unblinded raters (d= 0.48) reported significantly larger benefits relative to blinded raters and objective tests (both p{\textless} .05), indicating the likelihood of Hawthorne effects. Critical examination of training targets revealed incongruence with empirical evidence regarding the specific executive functions that are (a) most impaired in ADHD, and (b) functionally related to the behavioral and academic outcomes these training programs are intended to ameliorate. Collectively, meta-analytic results indicate that claims regarding the academic, behavioral, and cognitive benefits associated with extant cognitive training programs are unsupported in ADHD. The methodological limitations of the current evidence base, however, leave open the possibility that cognitive training techniques designed to improve empirically documented executive function deficits may benefit children with ADHD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In heart failure, cardiac output (supply) is decreased due to pathologic remodeling of the heart. To meet the demands of the body, the sympathetic system is activated and catecholamines stimulate $\beta$-adrenergic receptors ($\beta$-ARs) to increase contractile performance and cardiac output. Although this is beneficial in the acute phase, chronic $\beta$-ARs stimulation initiates a cascade of alterations at the cellular level, resulting in a diminished contractile performance of the heart.},

abstract = {The ability to generate items belonging to categories in verbal fluency tasks has been attributed to frontal cortex. Nonverbal fluency (e.g., design fluency) has been assessed separately and found to rely on the right hemisphere or right frontal cortex. The current study assessed both verbal and nonverbal fluency in a single group of patients with focal, frontal lobe lesions and age- and education-matched control participants. In the verbal fluency task, participants generated items belonging to both letter cues (F, A, and S) and category cues (animals and boys' names). In the design fluency task, participants generated novel designs by connecting dot arrays with 4 straight lines. A switching condition was included in both verbal and design fluency tasks and required participants to switch back and forth between different sets (e.g., between naming fruits and furniture). As a group, patients with frontal lobe lesions were impaired, compared to control participants, on both verbal and design fluency tasks. Patients with left frontal lesions performed worse than patients with right frontal lesions on the verbal fluency task, but the 2 groups performed comparably on the design fluency task. Both patients and control participants were impacted similarly by the switching conditions. These results suggest that verbal fluency is more dependent on left frontal cortex, while nonverbal fluency tasks, such as design fluency, recruit both right and left frontal processes.},

Thus, it assumes that planning comprises the activities of a variety of cognitive "specialists." Each specialist can suggest certain kinds of decisions for incorporation into the plan in progress. These include decisions about: (a) how to approach the planning problem; (b) what knowledge bears on the problem;.(c) what kinds of octions to try to plan; (d) what specific actions to plan; and (e) how to allocate cognitive resources during planning. Within each of these categories, different specialists suggest decisions at different levels of abstraction. The activities of the various specialists are not coordinated in ony systematic way. Instead, the speciolists operate opportunistically, suggesting decisions whenever promising opportunities arise. The paper presents a detailed account of the model and illustrates its assumptions with a "thinking aloud" protocol. It also describes the performance of a computer simulation of the model. The paper contrasts the proposed model with successive refinement models and attempts to resolve apparent differences between the two points of view.},

A multicenter study was carried out. Subjects ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 63, ≥ 39 years old) had DS with mild ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 39) or moderate ID ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 24) with no minor neurocognitive disorder or Alzheimer's disease. Assessment protocol: TOL {\textless}sup{\textgreater}DXtm{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for ID, Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test Second Edition (K-BIT II), Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of Older People with Down's Syndrome and Others with Intellectual Disabilities (CAMDEX-DS), Weigl's Color-Form Sorting Test (WCFST), Barcelona Test for Intellectual Disability (BT-ID), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-P). The internal consistency (ID {\textless}sub{\textgreater}Mi{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and ID {\textless}sub{\textgreater}Mo{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ), factor structure of the different subscales, and relationship between TOL {\textless}sup{\textgreater}DXtm{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} subscales and other cognitive measures (BT-ID, WCFST, and BRIEF-P) were analyzed. A normative data table with ID population quartiles is provided. TOL {\textless}sup{\textgreater}DXtm{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for ID showed a robust one factor structure and coherentassociations with other, related neuropsychological instruments. Significant differences between ID {\textless}sub{\textgreater}Mi{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and ID {\textless}sub{\textgreater}Mo{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} on movement-related variables like {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Correct (Corr; p = .002){\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Moves (Mov; p = .042){\textless}/italic{\textgreater} were observed, along with good internal consistency values, Corr ($\alpha$ = .75), Mov ($\alpha$ = .52). Regarding internal consistency, no between-groups differences were observed (all {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -value {\&}gt; 0.05). The TOL {\textless}sup{\textgreater}DXtm{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for ID is thus an instrument, supported by good validity evidence, to evaluate problem-solving and planning in ID. It distinguishes between individuals with mild and moderate ID, and is highly associated with other measures of executive functioning. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Persons with intellectual disability (ID) have been found to perform more poorly than their mental age would suggest in the visuo-spatial problem solving task Tower of Hanoi (TOH). Inefficient performance has been assumed to be related to inability to use sophisticated problem solving strategies because of restricted working memory capacity. In the present study, the TOH performance of adult persons with ID was found to be equal to that of fluid-intelligence-matched general children. However, persons with ID violated the rules of the TOH more often, and needed more trials to solve the TOH problems than the children did. Visuo-spatial and executive working memory tasks were significantly connected to the TOH performance of persons with ID, whereas phonological working memory tasks were not. Poor inhibition ability was related to the poor performance of subjects with ID in the TOH. We suggest that for persons with ID, TOH performance is determined by individual differences in fluid intelligence, controlled attention, and inhibition ability. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study examines the validity of a test of planning and problem solving (Tower of London) with adults with ID. Method: Participants completed an adapted version of the Tower of London (ToL) while day-centre staff completed adaptive function (Adaptive Behavior Scale—Residential and Community: Second Edition, modified version) and dysexecutive function (DEX-Independent Rater) questionnaires for each participant. Correlation analyses of test and questionnaire variables were undertaken. Results: The adapted ToL has a robust structure and shows significant associations with independent living skills, challenging behavior and behaviors related to dysexecutive function. Conclusions: The adapted ToL is a valid test for use with people with ID. However, there is also a need to develop other ecologically valid tools based on everyday planning tasks undertaken by people with ID.

People who knew the patients well (relatives or carers) completed a questionnaire about the patient's dysexecutive problems in everyday life, and this paper reports the extent to which the tests predicted the patients' everyday life problems. All of the tests were significantly predictive of at least some of the behavioral and cognitive deficits reported by patients' carers. However, factor analysis of the patients' dysexecutive symptoms suggested a fractionation of the dysexecutive syndrome, with neuropsychological tests loading differentially on 3 underlying cognitive factors (Inhibition, Intentionality, and Executive Memory), supporting the conclusions that different tests measure different cognitive processes, and that there may be limits to the fractionation of the executive system.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increased research interest in the functioning of working memory in people with intellectual disabilities. Although studies have repeatedly found these individuals to have weak working memory skills, few investigations have distinguished between different degrees of intellectual disability. This study aims to help close this research gap and, in so doing, to examine whether the deficits observed reflect a developmental lag or a qualitative deviation from normal development. Method In a 5-group design, the working memory performance of a group of 15-year-olds with mild intellectual disability (IQ 50–69) was compared with that of two groups of children (aged 10 and 15 years) with borderline intellectual disability (IQ 70–84) and with that of two groups of children with average intellectual abilities (IQ 90–115) matched for mental and chronological age (aged 7 and 15 years). All children were administered a comprehensive battery of tests assessing the central executive, the visual-spatial sketchpad, and the phonological loop. Results The results showed deficits in all three components of working memory, and revealed that these deficits increased with the degree of intellectual disability.The findings indicate that, relative to their mental age peers, children with learning difficulties show structural abnormalities in the phonological store of the phonological loop, but developmental lags in the other two subsystems. Conclusions Similar patterns of results emerged for both subgroups of children with intellectual disability, indicating that problems with phonological information processing seem to be one of the causes of cognitive impairment in individuals with intellectual disability.},

METHODS: A battery of working memory and achievement measures was administered to 11- to 12-year-old children with ID; younger typically developing children of comparable mental age were also assessed. RESULTS: The working memory measures that assessed phonological short-term memory (PSTM) accounted for the most variance in reading and spelling in children with ID, whereas the working memory measures that assessed central executive-loaded working memory (CELWM) accounted for the most variance in number skills. These relationships were broadly similar among typically developing children. CONCLUSIONS: Compensatory strategies for weak PSTM may help to improve reading and spelling skills in children with ID, whereas reducing CELWM loads may be more helpful in aiding their number skills.},

abstract = {Recipes are not only part of today's cooking culture, they are also part
of the Swedish syllabus of home economics. The aim of this study was to
investigate what kinds of difficulties students with mild intellectual
disabilities have using recipes during cooking lessons in home
economics. We conducted an ethnographically inspired approach, with a
total of 44 h of accompanying observations. Three compulsory schools for
students with intellectual disabilities were enrolled in the study, and
37 students and three teachers were included. The socio-cultural theory
of learning has been used as a theoretical framework. The findings
reveal both that recipes are central artefacts during the cooking
lessons and that the students have various difficulties using the
recipes. The difficulties vary, and they concern both how the recipes
are designed and the purport of the recipes. Difficulties in relation to
the design included, for example, the separation of ingredients and
instructions in the text and the large amount of information given in
both the whole and the parts of the recipes. The difficulties in
relation to the purport - that is, the meaning or sense of the recipe -
were the ingredients, the kitchen utensils and the knowledge of how to
perform a specific task. These difficulties can be considered special in
relation to the use of the recipes. We suggest the concept of `recipe
literacy' to capture the complex knowledge of using recipes.},

A mixed WM$\backslash$napproach, including both verbal and visuo-spatial components working$\backslash$nmainly on strategies, was the only significant training type with a$\backslash$nmedium ES.

abstract = {Background Executive functioning (EF) is an important concept in cognitive psychology that has rarely been studied in people with intellectual disabilities (IDs). The aim of this study was to examine the validity of two test batteries and the structure of EF in this client group. Methods We administered the children's version of the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS-C) and the Cambridge Executive Functioning Assessment (CEFA) for people with ID, to 40 participants who attended day centres for people with mild to moderate learning disabilities [mean full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) = 59]. The BADS-C consists of six EF subtests while the CEFA contains eight EF (including two executive memory) subtests and four memory subtests. IQ and receptive language ability were also assessed. The results were subjected to principal components analysis, and regression analysis was used to examine the relationship of the ensuing factors to other cognitive variables. Results Scores on both sets of EF tests were only weakly related to receptive language ability, and even more weakly related to IQ. Scores on the BADS-C were substantially lower than predicted from the published norms for people in higher IQ ranges, and many participants scored zero on three of the six subtests. This potential floor effect was less evident with scores on the CEFA. Principal components analyses produced one usable factor for the BADS-C, and two factors for the CEFA that differed in both the extent of involvement of working memory and the predominant sensory modality. A combined analysis of the subtests retained from both analyses produced three factors that related uniquely to aspects of IQ and memory. Conclusions The CEFA is suitable for use with people with mild to moderate learning disabilities, whereas the BADS-C is at the lower limit of usability with this client group. The lower-than-expected scores observed on the BADS-C may indicate that people known to learning disability services may be more impaired than people of comparable IQ not known to services. The structure of EF seen in people with IDs closely resembles a model of EF in the general population that has received a broad level of support.},

abstract = {The concept of community access is a multidimensional term, which may involve issues related to physical access, knowledge and information, power and control, relationships and communications, advocacy, participation and quality of life [21]. This paper discusses historical and emerging practices and interventions related to physical access to community and community based information for individuals with cognitive disabilities such as intellectual disability, autism or traumatic brain injury. While much societal attention has been paid to features of independent community access for populations such as individuals with hearing, vision or physical disabilities, less attention has focused on independent community access for people with intellectual and other significant cognitive disabilities. Attitudes and actions by families and professional service communities are often mixed for some individuals in this population. The somewhat limited research base in these areas is explored, including a case study review and results from several promising feasibility studies. The paper concludes with comments concerning future prospects and recommendations for improving independent community access for persons with significant cognitive disabilities.},

The sample included 684 autistic individuals ascertained from cases referred for the DSM-IV autism/PDD field trial collaborative study and five university sites with expertise in autism. Young children had higher standard scores than older individuals across all Vineland domains. In the Communication domain, younger verbal children were least impaired, older mute individuals most impaired, and younger mute and older verbal individuals in the midrange. Verbal individuals achieved higher scores in Daily Living Skills than mute individuals. The expected profile of a relative weakness in Socialization and relative strength in Daily Living Skills was obtained with age-equivalent but not standard scores. Results highlight the importance of employing Vineland special population norms as well as national norms when evaluating individuals with autism},

Ages: Birth to eighteen years. Published: 2003, The Psychological Corporation. Qualifications to Administer: Graduate training in clinical psychology and assessment. Stated Purpose: An assessment of an individual's responses to daily demands and capacity to live independently. Type of Instrument: Normative-referenced assessment instrument. Comments: The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-2nd Edition (ABAS-II) is an assessment of an individual's daily living skills, developed along the guidelines of the American Association of Mental Retardation. The three major areas of functioning assessed include Conceptual Reasoning, Social Interactions, and Practical Functioning. Specific aspects of functioning assessed include, communication, community use, functional activities, home living, health and safety, leisure, self-care, self-direction, social, work, and motor skills (for children). An overall Adaptive Behavior Score is derived. Information is gathered from parents, caregivers, teachers, and the individual assessed, assuming he/she is an adult. Computer scoring is available. Normative Data: Norms are age-based, but one can also obtain a profile of strengths and weaknesses with the scoring software. There is no specific mention of inclusion of those with visual impairment and multiple disabilities in the normative studies. It is unclear how applicable the available normative data may be for those with visual impairment or multiple disabilities. Standardization: The ABAS-3 does not require standardization in terms of administration procedure and interpretation for individuals with visual impairment or multiple disabilities as it is a series of checklists completed by parents, teachers and/or caregivers. Adaptations: No adaptations have been made or are required, as it is a questionnaire completed by others either independent of or with the individual with visual impairment or multiple disabilities.},

abstract = {Core executive functions (EF) such as attention, and working memory have been strongly associated with academic achievement, language development and behavioral stability. In the case of children who are vulnerable to cognitive and learning problems because of an underlying intellectual disability, EF difficulties will likely exacerbate an already compromised cognitive system. The current review examines cognitive training programs that aim to improve EF, specifically focusing on the potential of this type of intervention for children who have intellectual disabilities. We conclude that despite considerable discrepancies regarding reported intervention effects, these inconsistencies can be attributed to flaws in both program and study design. We discuss the steps needed to address these limitations and to facilitate the advancement of non-pharmaceutical interventions for children with intellectual disabilities.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The aim of the study was to explore the experiences of remote communication (i.e., communication between persons who are not in the same place) among people with communicative and cognitive disabilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven adolescents and adults were interviewed using Talking Mats and interview data was analyzed qualitatively with systematic text condensation. RESULTS The use of remote communication varies between the participants. The participants also value remote communication differently. Having the possibility to choose between different means of remote communication is important. Being able to determine whether to communicate independently or with support from another person is also valued as relevant. Strategies used to manage remote communication include facilitating for the communication partner and preparing for future communication situations. Those who are able to use writing as an alternative to problematic spoken remote communication like phone calls, for example by using chat or text messaging. Decisions regarding means of communication and human support relate to the concept of self-determination. CONCLUSION Better access to remote communication trough assistive technology such as speech synthesis and picture symbols would make remote communication easier and facilitate participation for people with communicative and cognitive disabilities. Implications for rehabilitation People with communicative and cognitive disabilities face challenges with access to remote communication. Access to communication technology including remote communication is important for self-determination, for personal safety and for overall participation in society. Communication technology should be considered in the rehabilitation process and training is crucial. To understand the possible benefits of remote communication, people with communicative and cognitive disability need to get the possibility to practice. Professionals play a key role in the assessment and intervention of remote communication for their patients.},

abstract = {Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Donald A. Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

abstract = {Our recentmeta-analysis concluded that training on working memory can improve performance on tests of fluid intelligence (Au et al., Psychon Bull Rev, 22(2), 366-377, 2015). Melby-Lerv{\aa}g and Hulme (Psychon Bull Rev, doi: 10.3758/s13423-015-0862-z) challenge this conclusion on the grounds that it did not take into consideration baseline differences on a by-study level and that the effects were pri- marily driven by purportedly less rigorous studies that did not include active control groups. Their re-analysis shows that accounting for baseline differences produces a statistically significant, but considerably smaller, overall effect size (g = 0.13 vs g = 0.24 in Au et al.), which loses significance after excluding studies without active controls. The present report demonstrates that evidence of impact variation by the active/ passive nature of control groups is ambiguous and also reveals important discrepancies between Melby-Lerv{\aa}g and Hulme's analysis and our original meta-analysis in terms of the coding and organization of data that account for the discrepant effect sizes.We demonstrate that there is in fact no evidence that the type of control group per se moderates the effects of working memory training on measures of fluid intelligence and reaf- firm the original conclusions in Au et al., which are robust to multiple methods of calculating effect size, including the one proposed by Melby-Lerv{\aa}g and Hulme.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND For some people with an intellectual disability (ID), the performance of daily life activities represents a certain number of challenges. Cognitive and adaptive limitations restrict the ability to make choices, solve problems, and evaluate the consequences of taken actions. One of the technological proposals raised by the scientific community is the use of domotics that would give a support that is daily, discreet and responsive to the needs of the person. However, the assistance provided must be personalized to the profile of the person (habits, skills, cognitive difficulties, etc.). METHOD The objective of the research is to test three guidance methods in order to determine which are the most appropriate to the cognitive profile of people. This research is conducted with 20 individuals (10 with ID and 10 with borderline ID). A quasi-experimental research design (measuring only after) is used. The independent variable is the type of guidance modalities (audio, photo and video) and the dependent variable is the number of positive responses (efficiency ratio) of the participant in these three different ways. Two appointments are scheduled with each participant. At the first appointment, a neuropsychological evaluation is conducted to assess executive and instrumental functions. In a second phase, the participant experience the guidance methods in the smart apartment of the Universit{\'{e}} du Qu{\'{e}}bec {\`{a}} Trois-Rivi{\`{e}}res. The participant must perform two tasks which are to prepare coffee and toast. Assistance is provided in the form of three terms of guidance (audio, photo and video). This guide is offered when a person makes a mistake or misses a crucial step to achieve the task. An observation grid is used to record the participant reactions during the tasks. RESULTS The results allow us to identify the best guidance methods to support people with an ID in the achievement of daily activities.CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This information can be used in the development of intervention methods suitable for people with ID.},

abstract = {Although attention has been given to the intellectual functioning of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) relative to their non-ADHD peers, few studies have examined intellectual functioning in adults with ADHD. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine differences in intellectual ability between adults with and without ADHD via a meta-analytic review. Of the 33 studies meeting inclusion criteria, primary analyses focused on 18 studies representing 1,031 adults with ADHD and 928 non-ADHD, nonclinical comparison adults and containing Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS; D. Wechsler, 1955, 1981, 1994) Full Scale IQ scores or estimates. A significant effect was found such that adults with ADHD scored lower than non-ADHD adults on WAIS intelligence tests. However, this difference was small and not clinically meaningful. The presence of several moderators reflecting characteristics of the ADHD samples and study methodology suggested that only a subset of adults with ADHD (e.g., those with comorbid disorders) may experience lower general intellectual ability relative to non-ADHD comparison adults. Implications of the findings for clinical and research settings are presented as well as suggestions for improving methodology and reporting in future research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are young and could have many years of productivity ahead of them. However, cognitive impairments may hinder individuals' ability to perform daily tasks. Assistive technology for cognition (ATC) can be effective in helping compensate for cognitive impairments. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the current state of the research on using ATCs to support daily activities for individuals with cognitive disabilities that are due to TBI. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2015. To evaluate the nature of the research, qualitative data were extracted pertaining to recruitment, participant characteristics, intervention design, type of ATCs and their functions, matching individuals with ATCs, training for using the ATC, and outcomes. RESULTS: Research examining the effectiveness of ATCs as everyday compensatory tools for cognitive impairments that are due to TBI is limited. The majority of studies were case studies or quasi-experimental studies with small sample sizes. Studies showed positive associations between use of ATCs and individuals' abilities to perform tasks regardless of age, TBI severity, and time since injury. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should assess the match between the individual and the technology, study the impact of training on using ATCs, and analyze the usability of ATCs.},

Given the pervasive effects executive functioning challenges have on independent living, professionals need methods of assessing these skills. OBJECTIVE: This study's purpose was to evaluate an ecologically-valid procedure to assess novel task planning and execution by adults with ABI. METHODS: The researchers implemented a single group design across two phases. Participants included nine adults with severe ABI. In the first experimental phase, participants created a plan for executing tasks that required adherence to pre-determined rules; in the second phase, participants executed the tasks. The researchers tallied information units recorded during the planning phase, performed momentary time-sampling to document observations about participant behaviors, and collected speed, accuracy, and rule violation data about task completion. RESULTS: Planning strategies implemented by most participants were limited to word-for-word copying of some or all of the specified tasks. On average, participants attempted and accurately performed less than half the required tasks and exhibited high rule violation rates. CONCLUSIONS: Given further development and refinement, the implemented procedures may serve as a basis for devel-oping an ecologically-valid tool for evaluating executive functioning in adults with ABI.},

This article summarizes the EF research that our group has conducted to understand the nature of individual differences in EFs and their cognitive and biological underpinnings. In the context of a new theoretical framework that we have been developing (the unity/diversity framework), we describe four general conclusions that have emerged from our research. Specifically, we argue that individual differences in EFs, as measured with simple laboratory tasks, (1) show both unity and diversity (different EFs are correlated yet separable); (2) reflect substantial genetic contributions; (3) are related to various clinically and societally important phenomena; and (4) show some developmental stability.},

The main objective of the present study was to examine whether WM performance can be enhanced in individuals with DS by analyzing the immediate and maintenance effects of a training program. For this purpose, 61 individuals with DS were randomly assigned to three groups: one trained on simultaneous components of visuospatial WM; one serving as an active control group, that completed activities on vocabulary; and one serving as a passive control group, that only attended the pre- and post-test and follow-up assessments. The efficacy of the training was analyzed in terms of specific (spatial-simultaneous WM tasks), near transfer (spatial-sequential and verbal WM tasks), far transfer (spatial abilities, everyday competences), and maintenance effects (with a follow-up at 1 month). The results showed an overall significant effect on the WM on the group receiving the training. The benefit was generally specific, however, with some transfer to other WM tasks, but only in the immediate (post-test) assessment.},

Due to cognitive impairments, some people need to be supported when performing ADL. In this paper, we present a technological approach to guide people with cognitive impairments to complete complex activities. The assistance is provided in the form of pervasive human-machine interactions (HMI), that encourage the person to complete some actions to settle the difficulty identified by the system. These HMI are called "acts of assistance". This approach was implemented in Archipel, a cognitive orthosis developed at the DOMUS Laboratory, University of Sherbrooke (Canada). An evaluation of the prototype was conducted around meal preparation activities, involving 12 people with intellectual disabilities. This study demonstrates that our approach is promising.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that working memory training programs are effective both as treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other cognitive disorders in children and as a tool to improve cognitive ability and scholastic attainment in typically developing children and adults. However, effects across studies appear to be variable, and a systematic meta-analytic review was undertaken. To be included in the review, studies had to be randomized controlled trials or quasi-experiments without randomization, have a treatment, and have either a treated group or an untreated control group. Twenty-three studies with 30 group comparisons met the criteria for inclusion. The studies included involved clinical samples and samples of typically developing children and adults. Meta-analyses indicated that the programs produced reliable short-term improvements in working memory skills. For verbal working memory, these near-transfer effects were not sustained at follow-up, whereas for visuospatial working memory, limited evidence suggested that such effects might be maintained. More importantly, there was no convincing evidence of the generalization of working memory training to other skills (nonverbal and verbal ability, inhibitory processes in attention, word decoding, and arithmetic). The authors conclude that memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize. Possible limitations of the review (including age differences in the samples and the variety of different clinical conditions included) are noted. However, current findings cast doubt on both the clinical relevance of working memory training programs and their utility as methods of enhancing cognitive functioning in typically developing children and healthy adults.},

Here, we use latent growth curve (LGC) models to assess associations between SES and individual differences in the intelligence starting point (intercept) and in the rate and direction of change in scores (slope and quadratic term) from infancy through adolescence in 14,853 children from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), assessed 9 times on IQ between the ages of 2 and 16. years. SES was significantly associated with intelligence growth factors: higher SES was related both to a higher starting point in infancy and to greater gains in intelligence over time. Specifically, children from low SES families scored on average 6 IQ points lower at age 2 than children from high SES backgrounds; by age 16, this difference had almost tripled. Although these key results did not vary across girls and boys, we observed gender differences in the development of intelligence in early childhood. Overall, SES was shown to be associated with individual differences in intercepts as well as slopes of intelligence. However, this finding does not warrant causal interpretations of the relationship between SES and the development of intelligence.},

The approach is designed to accommodate the widest variety of ATD applications, reflecting combinations of user population, ATD type, service, and context for use. In essence, the provisional taxonomy proposes that ATD outcomes can be effectively operationalized from three vantages--effectiveness, social significance, and subjective well-being. It emphasizes a distinction between the proximal effect of ATDs and the more distal outcomes associated with their use. Because it promotes consistency in the language used for categorizing outcomes, the taxonomic approach should facilitate the development of ATD-specific causal models.

Cognitive interviewing was used to identify items needing clarification. A revised CATOM and manual were then reviewed by clinicians. After revising some items based on the interview findings, the measure was piloted as part of an intervention study examining the impact of assistive technology on the users' informal caregivers (n = 44).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Based on a review of 12 existing measures, a 3-part measure was developed and questions were refined based on cognitive interviews with informal caregivers and feedback experienced assistive technology practitioners. For the activity-specific and overall portions of the measure, the 6-week, test-retest intraclass correlations coefficients were 0.88 (95{\%} CI 0.64-0.96) and 0.86 (95{\%} CI 0.60-0.95), respectively.

METHOD: The terms, 'assistive technology outcomes research' and 'assistive technology interventions', are defined. Several bases are examined for the shortage of outcomes research pertaining to mobility-related assistive technology interventions. Three presuppositions are described for the research strategy of interlocking studies being recommended. They are assigning priority to evaluating both recently developed assistive technologies and ones that have long been available, acknowledging the complexity of assistive technology as an intervention, and appreciating the trade-offs necessary for strengthening studies' internal and external validity. Some key study preparations are considered, including treatment theory, treatment specification, and the selection of outcome domains and measures. The essential features of efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness studies are outlined, and their interdependence is stressed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To assess the outcomes of assistive technology interventions for mobility in ways that are both methodologically sound and relevant to stakeholder needs, a research strategy is required involving mutually reinforcing efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness studies. Collaborative arrangements and funding methods are discussed for fostering the needed research.},

First, a list of potential key variables relevant to the caregivers of assistive technology users was generated from a review of the existing literature and semistructured interviews with caregivers. Second, the variables were analyzed, regrouped, and partitioned, using a conceptual mapping approach. Third, the key areas were anchored in a general stress model of caregiving. Finally, the judgments of rehabilitation experts were used to evaluate the conceptual framework. RESULTS: An important result of this study is the identification of a complex set of variables that need to be considered when examining the experience of caregivers of assistive technology users. Stressors, such as types of assistance, number of tasks, and physical effort, are predominant contributors to caregiver outcomes along with caregivers' personal resources acting as mediating factors (intervening variables) and assistive technology acting as a key moderating factor (effect modifier variable). CONCLUSIONS: Recipients' use of assistive technology can enhance caregivers' well being because of its potential for alleviating a number of stressors associated with caregiving. Viewed as a whole, this work demonstrates that the assistive technology experience of caregivers has many facets that merit the attention of outcomes researchers.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper evaluates four classifications of assistive technology (AT) services for their ability to support outcomes research. The evaluation involved classifications intended for various purposes, including those created to support practitioner education and third-party reimbursement decisions. Each was analyzed according to a common framework: a) purpose, b) completeness, c) granularity, and d) research application. Each classification addresses the gamut of service provision steps, including client intake, assessment, and training, as well as device maintenance and repair. The classifications differed markedly in the granularity with which each step is described. None of the classifications attempts to dimensionalize the service provision steps in terms of intensity, duration, frequency, or other indicators of service quality. The findings suggest that existing AT service classifications do not fully meet the needs of AT outcomes researchers. A common taxonomy of AT services is thus needed to advance the science of AT device outcomes research. A preliminary classification of services is presented as a basis for future development.

abstract = {The concept of product usability has been discussed in several areas of product research and development. Usability, within the realm of assistive technology (AT) devices, determines how effectively and efficiently AT users with disabilities can function in different contexts and environments. OBJECTIVE: This article conceptualizes and proposes the significance of AT usability and its measurement in entirety from a human factors perspective. Conceptual models that characterize the interaction of the AT user, the AT device, the context and the involved activity is considered to be the hallmark of measurement of AT usability. On that basis, the article highlights the methodology and the initial progress of the development of an AT outcome tool, the Usability Scale for Assistive Technology (USAT), to measure self reported degree of AT usability. METHODOLOGY: In order to identify usability indicators for measurement, a qualitative study was conducted by exploring the experiences of AT users. Ten participants who used either wheeled mobility or computer based AT devices were interviewed with questions based on the theme of a usability framework. RESULTS: The coded interview data generated more than 800 usability indicators specific to the two categories of AT devices. These indicators were mapped to a generic usability criteria list for construction of the USAT-Wheeled Mobility and the USAT-Computer Access. IMPLICATIONS: The USAT, when developed, is projected to be valid and useful for AT outcomes research as well as clinical practice. The use of the USAT will enable researchers and clinicians to comprehensively identify factors that underlie effectiveness and efficiency in AT device use and establish intervention protocols to optimize user-AT interaction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A key step in planning assistive technology outcomes research is formulation of a conceptual model, specific to a particular type of device, that provides a rationale for the expected outcomes. This paper reflects the conviction that the development of device-specific causal models will be facilitated by having available an overarching framework that is potentially applicable to multifarious types of devices and their outcomes. METHOD: A literature review identified the critical, unmet needs for a conceptual framework. The assumptions underlying the framework were specified preparatory to describing it and discussing its implications. RESULTS: The outcomes of assistive technology devices are depicted as resulting from the interaction among characteristics of a specific device-type, its users, and their environment. Initial junctures include procurement of a type of device and a period of introductory use that, interacting with various moderating co-factors, result in a variety of shorter-term outcomes, possible longer-term use, and its outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The framework has the potential of facilitating the development of device-specific causal models. It also may contribute to developing a research agenda for assistive technology outcomes research by highlighting measures that need to be developed and by identifying testable hypotheses concerned, for example, with the manner and duration of devices' usage.},

The neural substrate for executive functions is described, including relevant functional brain imaging studies that have implicated mediation by prefrontal and parietal cortex and their circuitry. The vulnerability of the neural substrate for executive function to the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury is discussed, including focal lesions and diffuse axonal injury. Domains of executive functions covered in this review include the basic processes of working memory and inhibition and more complex processes such as decision making. Other domains of executive function, including motivation, self-regulation, and social cognition are discussed in terms of research methodology, clinical assessment, and findings in children with traumatic brain injury.

With cognitive assistive technology (e.g. electronic planning devices [EPDs] and individual support), they can bring order to their often chaotic life. Assumptions are that environmental factors influence with non-use of EPDs. Objective: To explore how adults with cognitive disabilities perceive the influence of environmental factors in the use of EPDs. Methods: A reference group with experience of use of EPDs assisted the researchers. Twelve adults with cognitive disabilities and experience of using EPDs participated. An interview guide was implemented covering environmental factors according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Qualitative content analysis was applied in the analyses. Results: Five categories and two themes emerged, which were integrated into a model of facilitating factors influencing the use of EPDs. Measures to prevent or eliminate negative influences of the device use are important to be taken. Conclusions: Professionals need more knowledge about EPDs, while users need individual adaption of the EPDs. EPDs need to be user-friendly, manageable and work in any seasons. Implications for Rehabilitation The users should have access to specially trained prescribers. There is a need for development of user-friendly and manageable products to function in any climate. Knowledge is lacking on how to implement the users in all stages of the prescribing process. Prescribers should increase knowledge in the use of EPDs to influence the attitudes of the social environment.},

abstract = {People with cognitive disabilities such as dementia and intellectual disabilities tend to have problems in coordinating steps in the execution of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) due to limited capabilities in cognitive functioning. To successfully perform ADLs, these people are reliant on the assistance of human caregivers. This leads to a decrease of independence for care recipients and imposes a high burden on caregivers. Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC) aims to compensate for decreased cognitive functions. ATC systems provide automatic assistance in task execution by delivering appropriate prompts which enable the user to perform ADLs without any assistance of a human caregiver. This leads to an increase of the user's independence and to a relief of caregiver's burden. In this article, we describe the design, development and evaluation of a novel ATC system. The TEBRA (TEeth BRushing Assistance) system supports people with moderate cognitive disabilities in the execution of brushing teeth. A main requirement for the acceptance of ATC systems is context awareness: explicit feedback from the user is not necessary to provide appropriate assistance. Furthermore, an ATC system needs to handle spatial and temporal variance in the execution of behaviors such as different movement characteristics and different velocities. The TEBRA system handles spatial variance in a behavior recognition component based on a Bayesian network classifier. A dynamic timing model deals with temporal variance by adapting to different velocities of users during a trial. We evaluate a fully functioning prototype of the TEBRA system in a study with people with cognitive disabilities. The main aim of the study is to analyze the technical performance of the system and the user's behavior in the interaction with the system with regard to the main hypothesis: is the TEBRA system able to increase the user's independence in the execution of brushing teeth?},

abstract = {The advanced technology of today's society is challenging for persons with disabilities. One way to handle these challenges is assistive technology, such as powered wheelchairs for persons with motor disability or synthetic speech for persons with communication disability. The use of assistive technology has been minimal for a large group of persons with disabilities, namely persons with cognitive disability. This is probably due to the fact that cognitive disability is more difficult to observe and measure than other disabilities, like motor disability. The handicapping consequences of the disability on the person-environment interaction cannot be directly observed and therefore must be deduced from behavior in task-analysis. Thus, unlike observable disabilities, the need for assistive technology is not self-evident in persons with cognitive disabilities. This paper describes a model for developing assistive technology for cognitive disability, illustrated by a case study. The model was developed in the MENTEK project, sponsored by the Swedish Handicap Institute. The model is based on the international classification of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps (ICIDH) and stresses the importance of differentiating between cognitive impairment, cognitive disability and cognitive handicap. Assistive technology can be used either to minimize the disability with the help of a cognitive aid, like a device for understanding the passage of time, or to minimize the handicapping consequences of the disability in a specific context, like a computerized cash-register helping a person to handle money in a coffee-shop.},

The aims of this study were to pilot an ecological open-ended assessment of executive functions in children, the ‘Children's Cooking Task' (CCT), specifically to report its reliability, discriminant validity and concurrent validity. Methods: Twenty-five children with mild (n = 10) or moderate-to-severe TBI (n = 15), and 21 matched controls (aged 8 to 20 years) participated in the study. An open-ended cooking task was designed to test multi-tasking abilities. It required the preparation of two simple recipes using specific instructions. Outcome measures included the number of errors and an overall qualitative analysis of the task. Validating measures of executive functions included the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System, the Six-Part Test and two questionnaires completed by the child's primary care-giver: the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire for Children. Results: Internal consistency of the Children's Cooking Task was high (Cronbach's alpha = .86), as was test–retest reliability (ICC = .89). Children with moderate-to-severe TBI, as well as children with mild TBI made significantly more errors in the Children's Cooking Task in comparison to controls (p {\textless} .001). The CCT was correlated with several tests and one questionnaire of executive functioning (Trails, verbal fluency, sorting, 20 questions, Dysexecutive Questionnaire). Discussion and Conclusion: The Children's Cooking Task has good interrater and test–retest reliability, as well as good discriminant and concurrent validity.

abstract = {Planning, which concerns many activities in everyday life, is a two-stage process. The first one predetermines a course of actions aimed at achieving some specific goals. It is founded on managerial knowledge or overlearned sequences of events and may be tested by script generation. The second stage entails monitoring and guiding the execution of the plan to a successful conclusion. It must take into account environmental contingencies and may be tested by script execution. If the frontal lobes intervene not only in managerial knowledge (Grafman, 1989) but also in binding the plan with contextual environment (Damasio, Tranel and Damasio, 1991; Shallice and Burgess, 1991), script execution would be more sensitive than script generation to planning deficits. To test this hypothesis, script execution and script generation were compared in 11 patients with a dysexecutive syndrome and 10 matched controls, using three scripts of daily life activities: (1) ‘shopping for groceries'; (2) ‘cooking'; (3) ‘answering a letter and finding the way to post the reply'. Two way {\{}ANOVAs{\}} showed more errors in execution than in generation, more errors in patients than in controls, and a greater difference between execution and generation in patients than in controls. Furthermore, ‘context neglect' and ‘environmental adherence' were the two types of errors that best differentiated patients from controls. Finally, the total number of errors in execution correlated with the score on behavioral questionnaires answered by occupational therapists. These results confirm our hypothesis and suggest that script execution may be a valid ecological approach to estimate the severity of deficits in daily life activities. },

It defines components of health and some health-related components of well-being (such as education and labour). The domains contained in ICF can, therefore, be seen as health domains and health-related domains. These domains are described from the perspective of the body, the individual and society in two basic lists: (1) Body Functions and Structures; and (2) Activities and Participation.2 As a classification, ICF systematically groups different domains3 for a person in a given health condition (e.g. what a person with a disease or disorder does do or can do). Functioning is an umbrella term encompassing all body functions, activities and participation; similarly, disability serves as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations or participation restrictions. ICF also lists environmental factors that interact with all these constructs. In this way, it enables the user to record useful profiles of individuals' functioning, disability and health in various domains},

The purpose of cognitive assistive devices is to compensate for cognitive problems, to enhance independence when performing activities and to support decision making in daily life. Nine persons, 17-37 years old, with mild intellectual disability were selected by purposive sampling. Data collection was conducted by semi-structured interviews. The results showed that participation in everyday activities increased when using cognitive assistive devices. The persons experienced having more control and health benefits using cognitive assistive devices in daily activities. There were participation restrictions related to attitudes from the social network towards participation, and attitudes towards the use of cognitive assistive devices from the persons themselves and from the social network. Occupational therapists should be aware of the social factors that may influence a client's participation in everyday activities when using cognitive assistive devices.

abstract = {For close to 20 years, clinicians and researchers have been developing and assessing technological interventions for individuals with either acquired impairments or developmental disorders. This paper offers a comprehensive review of literature in that field, which we refer to collectively as assistive technology for cognition (ATC). ATC interventions address a range of func-tional activities requiring cognitive slulls as diverse as complex attention, executive reasoning, prospective memory, self-monitoring for either the enhancement or inhibition of specific behaviours and sequential processing. ATC interventions have also been developed to address the needs of individ-uals with information processing impairments that may affect visual, auditory and language ability, or the understanding of social cues. The literature reviewed indicates that ATC interventions can increase the efficiency of tradi-tional rehabilitation practices by enhancing a person's ability to engage in ther-apeutic tasks independently and by broadening the range of contexts in which those tasks can be exercised. More importantly, for many types of impair-ments, ATC interventions represent entirely new methods of treatment that can reinforce a person's residual intrinsic abilities, provide alternative means by which activities can be completed or provide extrinsic supports so that func-tional activities can be performed that might otherwise not be possible. Although the major focus of research in this field will continue to be the devel-opment of new ATC interventions, over the coming years it will also be critical for researchers, clinicians, and developers to examine the multi-system factors that affect usability over time, generalisability across home and community settings, and the impact of sustained, patterned technological interventions on recovery of function. As clinicians and researchers seek new ways to serve people with cognitive and neuropsychological disabilities, many have incorporated computers and other advanced technologies into clinical interventions (Bergman, 1998). These technological interventions, often referred to as "cognitive orthoses" or "cognitive prostheses" (and to which we will refer collectively in this paper as assistive technology for cognition or ATC), range from alarms to remind people of their medication schedules to interactive robotic caregivers. Some draw on technology designed for the mainstream population, while others are designed for the unique needs of people with disabilities, but all are typically designed to provide extrinsic supports for individuals with compromised cognitive ability. ATC interventions can aid people with a variety of disabilities, including traumatic brain injury Depending on the specific needs of the person, these technologies may be used in a number of ways. One approach capitalises on those of a person's skills that have not been compromised so that tasks can be accomplished using alternative strategies or information characteristics. For example, an ATC intervention may include a computer that allows speech recognition rather than typing for a person with poor visual letter recognition but strong verbal language skills. Similarly, a personal digital assistant (PDA) may be used for daily planning by a person with memory impairments but relatively intact executive skills or a software interface may be designed that accom-modates visual-perceptual or information processing impairments. For more severely impaired individuals, an alternative approach has been to develop extrinsic interventions that assume greater responsibility for initi-ation, cueing, activity guidance, and maintenance of daily information. For example, an ATC intervention may be designed that, in addition to providing},

Potentially useful features were found in four categories: Transit apps for (1) individuals with cognitive disabilities and (2) healthy individuals, and personal navigation apps for (3) individuals with cognitive disabilities and (4) healthy individuals. A total of 159 apps were examined, but only seven were found specific to public transit for cognitive disability.

abstract = {Executive functions (EFs) make possible mentally playing with ideas; taking the time to think before acting; meeting novel, unanticipated challenges; resisting temptations; and staying focused. Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control--resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking "outside the box," seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances). The developmental progression and representative measures of each are discussed. Controversies are addressed (e.g., the relation between EFs and fluid intelligence, self-regulation, executive attention, and effortful control, and the relation between working memory and inhibition and attention). The importance of social, emotional, and physical health for cognitive health is discussed because stress, lack of sleep, loneliness, or lack of exercise each impair EFs. That EFs are trainable and can be improved with practice is addressed, including diverse methods tried thus far.},

@article{Miyake2000,
abstract = {This individual differences study examined the separability of three often postulated executive functions-mental set shifting ("Shifting"), information updating and monitoring ("Updating"), and inhibition of prepotent responses ("Inhibition")-and their roles in complex "frontal lobe" or "executive" tasks. One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

abstract = {We present a new framework characterizing training-induced changes in WM as the acquisition of novel cognitive routines akin to learning a new skill. Predictions were tested in three studies analyzing the transfer between WM tasks following WM training. Study 1 reports a meta-analysis establishing substantial transfer when trained and untrained tasks shared either a serial recall, complex span or backward span paradigm. Transfer was weaker for serial recall of verbal than visuo-spatial material, suggesting that this paradigm is served by an existing verbal STM system and does not require a new routine. Re-analysis of published WM training data in Study 2 showed that transfer was restricted to tasks sharing properties proposed to require new routines. In a re-analysis of data from four studies, Study 3 demonstrated that transfer was greatest for children with higher fluid cognitive abilities. These findings suggest that development of new routines depends on general cognitive resources and that they can only be applied to other similarly-structured tasks.},
